My name is Frank Kesel. I am a professor at the [University of Applied Sciences in Pforzheim](https://www.hs-pforzheim.de), which is not far from Stuttgart, Germany.
I am teaching and researching in the fields of digital hardware design with FGPAs and programming of Embedded Systems based on microcontrollers or single-board computers. I am working mainly with Xilinx FPGAs and offer trainings on this topic (see [Trainings](trainings.md)). I will also start to offer tutorials on Xilinx tools which you will find [here](https://github.com/FrankKesel/xilinx_tools).
